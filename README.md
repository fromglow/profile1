# Portfolio of Previous Work
Here, you can see a few assignments that I have worked on that demonstrate my skills in data science. 

There are projects on machine learning and data science in this repository, with work on natural language processing, clustering, and images. I have robust experience in SQL, Power BI, Excel and Excel Pivot Charts, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SWIFT as well. 

I am actively looking for opportunities and am open to roles in employment - please contact me on my LinkedIn - linkedin.com/in/dhanushvg/

With regards to my work and academic background: I have two STEM degrees (BSc Physics with Theoretical Physics and MSc Data Science and AI), research experience with data, work and commercial and internship experience with data - all of which makes me more than suited to any data science role, and this portfolio is just one representation of the depth of technical (and soft) skills that I have. 

If there is any feedback, any work you would like to be better cited/documented, or anything else: please let me know through the contact I have provided above. This Github profile is not regularly monitored and this is a space to display a portfolio of previous work.
