# Portfolio of Previous Work
Here, you can see a few assignments that I have worked on that demonstrate my skills in data science. 

There's projects on machine learning and data science in this repository, with work on natural language processing, clustering, and images. I have robust experience in SQL, JavaScript, Power BI, Excel and Excel Pivot Charts, SWIFT as well. 

I am actively looking for opportunities and am open to roles in employment - please contact me on my LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanush-g-8898b911a/

With regards to my work and academic background: I have two STEM degrees, research experience with data, work and commercial and internship experience with data - all of which makes me more than suited to any data science role, and this portfolio is just one representation of the depth of technical (and soft) skills that.
